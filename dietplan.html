                    children under 5 who are overweight can improve their health by meeting the activity guidelines , even if their weight does not change. To achieve and maintain a healthy weight,they may need to do additional activity and make dietary
                    changes.It is normal for young children to refuse to eat new foods, change their minds about foods they ate before, or want the same food every day. Continue to have meals and snacks at the same time each day and include a variety
                    of foods.

                    by a physician or registered dietitian nutritionist. A teenager’s weight is only concerning if their weight on a growth chart has been increasing over time in the overweight or obese categories.The typical goal for overweight teenagers
                    is not necessarily to lose weight, but to “grow into their weight” as they hit their growth spurts. It’s common for a teen to gain weight before they hit a growth spurt and slim out. The best thing a teenager can do now is to develop
                    healthy diet habits, not go on a diet.

                    The amounts should be eaten throughout the day between meals and snacks. What counts as an ounce? One egg, 24 pistachios, 1/4 cup of cooked black beans are each the same as one ounce. One small chicken breast half is the same as 3
                    ounces. A good rule of thumb is to think of a deck of cards as about the size of three ounces, and one ounce is about the size of a golf ball.

                    can feel like an insurmountable challenge, given our food culture and dietary habits. For instance, a typical Indian meal is high in carbohydrates and sugar – we eat a lot of potatoes, rice, and sweets.

                    women. Eat lean proteins. Try foods such as skinless chicken, fatty fish like salmon (with omega-3 fats), and vegetable protein, including soy.
